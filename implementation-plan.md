# Mathematical AMM Toolkit - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Mathematical AMM Toolkit demonstrates Fluentbase's "blended execution" capabilities by creating a modular system where Solidity handles standard DeFi operations while Rust contracts perform computationally expensive mathematical calculations. This project serves as both an educational resource and a foundation for advanced DeFi primitives.

### Core Design Philosophy

- **Computational complexity threshold**: Keep simple operations in Solidity, outsource mathematical complexity to Rust
- **Educational first**: Clear demonstration of when and why to use Rust over Solidity
- **Feature-driven evolution**: Add capabilities based on partner feedback and real-world usage
- **Modular architecture**: Each component provides standalone value while working together

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Week 1)

_Goal: Demonstrate the concept works with clear gas savings_

### **Understanding the Technical Distinction**

**Constant Product AMMs vs Bonding Curves are fundamentally different:**

- **Constant Product AMM**: `x * y = k` - facilitates trading between two existing tokens
- **Bonding Curves**: `price = f(supply)` - token issuance mechanism where price depends on total supply

**Where Rust provides value for AMMs:**

- Not the basic `x * y = k` formula itself (simple arithmetic)
- But the **mathematical operations around it** that are computationally expensive in Solidity

### Core Components

#### **Solidity: Basic AMM Contract**

```solidity
contract MathematicalAMM {
    // Standard liquidity management
    function addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) external;
    function removeLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 liquidity) external;
    
    // Basic swap with simple approximations
    function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn) external;
    
    // Enhanced swap with Rust mathematical optimizations
    function enhancedSwap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn) external;
    
    // Separate bonding curve demonstration
    function buyTokensFromCurve(uint256 ethAmount) external;
    function sellTokensToCurve(uint256 tokenAmount) external;
}
```

#### **Rust: Mathematical Operations Engine**

```rust
// AMM mathematical enhancements
pub trait AMMEngine {
    fn calculate_precise_slippage(amount_in: U256, reserve_in: U256, reserve_out: U256, fee_rate: f64) -> U256;
    fn optimize_square_root(amount0: U256, amount1: U256) -> U256;  // For LP token calculations
    fn calculate_dynamic_fee(volatility: f64, volume_24h: U256, liquidity_depth: U256) -> U256;
    fn find_optimal_route(token_in: Address, token_out: Address, pools: Vec<Pool>) -> OptimalRoute;
}

// Separate bonding curve primitives for educational comparison
pub trait BondingCurveEngine {
    fn calculate_sigmoid_price(supply: U256, params: SigmoidParams) -> U256;
    fn calculate_mint_amount(eth_amount: U256, current_supply: U256) -> U256;
    fn calculate_burn_proceeds(token_amount: U256, current_supply: U256) -> U256;
}

struct SigmoidParams {
    amplitude: U256,    // A
    steepness: U256,    // k  
    midpoint: U256,     // B
}
```

### **Specific Rust Optimizations Demonstrated**

1. **Square Root Operations**: LP token calculations
   - Solidity: ~20,000 gas (iterative Babylonian method)
   - Rust: ~2,000 gas (native sqrt operation)
   - **Savings: 90%**

2. **Precise Slippage Calculations**: High-precision arithmetic for better MEV protection
   - Solidity: Integer division with precision loss
   - Rust: Floating-point intermediate calculations with proper rounding
   - **Benefit: Reduced MEV opportunities**

3. **Dynamic Fee Models**: Volatility-based fee adjustment
   - Solidity: Impossible (requires complex mathematical functions)
   - Rust: Native exponential and logarithmic functions
   - **Benefit: Revenue optimization**

4. **Multi-hop Route Optimization**: Finding best trading paths
   - Solidity: Limited to 2-3 hops due to gas constraints
   - Rust: Complex optimization algorithms across 5+ pools
   - **Benefit: Better execution prices**

### Deliverables

- Working AMM with enhanced mathematical operations (Rust-powered)
- Separate bonding curve primitive for educational comparison
- Gas comparison dashboard showing specific operation improvements
- Basic web interface demonstrating both AMM trading and bonding curve token purchases
- Documentation clearly explaining the technical distinctions and optimization opportunities

### Success Criteria

- **Clear gas savings**: 50-90% reduction on mathematical operations (square roots, precise calculations)
- **Educational clarity**: Developers understand when AMMs vs bonding curves are appropriate
- **Precision improvements**: Demonstrable accuracy gains for slippage and LP calculations
- **Capability demonstration**: Show mathematical operations impossible in pure Solidity
